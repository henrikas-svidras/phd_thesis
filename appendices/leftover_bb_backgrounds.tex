\chapter{Remaining-\texorpdfstring{\BB}{BB} background after the \texorpdfstring{\Mbc}{Mbc} fitting}\label{sec:appendix_remaining_bb}

As seen in \Cref{sec:background_normalisation_systematic},
a significant amount of non-\BtoXsgamma events are captured in the estimated numbers of good tag-\B mesons.
This is related to the fact that an irreducible background component remains in the analysis due to the inclusive treatment of the $X_s$ system.
The composition of this component for $\Bp$ and $\Bz$ decays is shown in \Cref{tab:leftover_bz,tab:leftover_bp}.
The results are calculated based on Belle II \MC and show the fraction of \B decays that contribute within a given \EB interval.
Only decay channels which contribute by at least 1\% in at least one of the \EB intervals are listed.
Particularly, in low-\EB regions thousands of decay channels may contribute to the background, therefore, the decay channels listed in the tables only cover a fraction of them.
