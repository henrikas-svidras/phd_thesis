\chapter{Major production cross sections at \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B} factories}\label{sec:appendix_major_production_cross_sections}

Although $B$ factories specialise at the measurement of products \FourS decays, there are many more processes that can occur in an
$\epem$ collision.
These processes are summarised in the \Cref{tab:cross_section}.
Three main categories of decays are the \BB events, continuum events and low-multiplicity events.
$\BB$ are usually the main decay type of interest.
Continuum events correspond to the continuous hadronic (and \tau lepton).
The low-multiplicity events are named as such due to the low number of charged particles present in the final state of such collisions.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \caption{\label{tab:cross_section}
    The largest production cross sections at $B$ factories.
    The processes are split up into three conventional categories, that are used to refer to the decay processes.
    The details on each of the numbers can be found in \cite{Belle-II:2018jsg}.
