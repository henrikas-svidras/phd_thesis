\chapter{Major production cross sections at \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B}~factories}\label{sec:appendix_major_production_cross_sections}

Although $B$ factories specialise in measuring the products of \FourS decays, many more processes can occur in an
$\epem$ collision.
These processes are summarised in the \Cref{tab:cross_section}.
Three main categories are the \BB events, continuum events and low-multiplicity events.
$\BB$ are usually the main decay type of interest.
Continuum events correspond to the hadronic (and $\tau$~lepton) events.
The low-multiplicity events are named as such due to the low number of charged particles present in the final state of such collisions.

\begin{table}[htbp!]

    \caption{\label{tab:cross_section}
    The largest production cross sections at $B$~factories.
    The processes are split up into three conventional categories that are often used to refer to the processes.
    The details on each of the numbers can be found in Ref.~\cite{Belle-II:2018jsg}.
