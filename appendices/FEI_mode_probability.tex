\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\FEI}{FEI} signal probability for specific channels of \texorpdfstring{\B}{B}}\label{sec:appendix_fei_signal_probabilities}

In general, \FEI signal probability cannot be a good quantity for a quantitative evaluation of reconstruction quality because different classifier chains are necessary to reconstruct \Bp and \Bz candidates.
This is discussed for the comparison between \feiBp and \feiBz modes in \Cref{sec:reconstruction_overview}.
However, even for specific channels for a given $B$ modes \feiProb is not a well-calibrated quantity.
This is shown in \Cref{fig:feisigprobs1,fig:feisigprobs2} for \Bp modes and \Cref{fig:feisigprobs3,fig:feisigprobs4} for \Bz modes.
Different distributions have strongly differing shapes, which translate to different selection efficiency and/or purity.
Therefore, a general selection on \feiProb necessarily results in a direct bias to the 
selected tag-side modes and may not necessarily correspond to the `best' reconstructed mode.

    Some figures are empty because no modes are reconstructed in those channels (either due to insufficient statistics, or no training available for said modes.)
    The legend, y and x axes are shared among all plots.
