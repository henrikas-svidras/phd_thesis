\chapter{Summary and outlook}\label{ch:summary}

In this thesis, the radiative \BtoXsgamma decays have been studied using 189~\invfb of \epem collision data collected at the \FourS resonance by the Belle~II experiment.
These decays are important probes of the Standard Model and beyond, providing relevant information to deepen the understanding of nature.
This is studied through the measurement of \BtoXsgamma photon energy spectrum shape, its moments and the total branching fraction.

\Crefrange{ch:theory}{ch:analysis_techniques} provided an overview of the theoretical and experimental status of \mbox{\BtoXsgamma}, introduced the state-of-the-art \B factory Belle~II and summarised the most relevant analysis techniques used in high energy physics.
\Cref{ch:analysis} described the analysis
of the \BtoXsgamma decays using a hadronic-tagging approach, where the partnering \B mesons from the \FourS decay is also reconstructed.
In the inclusive treatment, only the high energy photon is reconstructed, ensuring that all $X_s$ states are selected.
Hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma has been measured for the first time in the Belle~II experiment, and for the second time, in general.
It is an important measurement technique which allows direct measurements of observables in the decaying \B meson rest frame.
\Cref{ch:overview} discussed the analysis results in the context of past measurements, future outlook and current impact.

This \BtoXsgamma analysis used the Full Event Interpretation algorithm, which is a series of boosted decision trees, to reconstruct the second tag-\B meson in \FourS decays.
As a result, this analysis described the steps to suppress two types of background: those related to the signal-side (photon backgrounds) and those related to the tag-side.
Photon backgrounds have been suppressed by employing multivariate algorithms and selections.
The tag-side backgrounds were suppressed by extracting the counts of correctly-reconstructed tag-\B mesons in different photon-energy bins.
The remaining photon backgrounds were then removed in a simulation-reliant way.
The analysis selections and the overall procedure have been tested and validated on numerous independent processes, including other \B decays, \mbox{\epem\ra\qqbar}, \mbox{\epem\ra\mumu}.
The results obtained in this thesis, also available in Ref.~\cite{Belle-II:2022hys}, show excellent agreement with the world averages and the Standard Model predictions.
They are compiled in the Table below.

The current version of the analysis contains a large statistical uncertainty component. 
This will be reduced in the future, as more and more data is collected by the Belle~II experiment.
The systematic uncertainty strongly depends on the lower photon energy threshold which is employed to suppress background.
Indeed, it was seen to be one of the largest uncertainty components in this thesis, where a threshold of 1.8~\gev was used.
In the future versions of this analysis, improved understanding of the background can reduce the systematic uncertainty down to $5-10\%$.
Such precision is highly anticipated in many global fits, such as that of the SIMBA collaboration.
While the current results may not provide a significant impact to the theoretical averages, they serve as the first stepping stone for future Belle~II radiative hadronic-tagged analyses that will be leading contenders in the world of flavour physics.
