\chapter{Overview of the results and future prospects}\label{ch:overview}

The full analysis setup and the branching fraction measurement results in 
\Cref{sec:partial_branching_fraction_results,sec:total_branching_fraction_results}
are the final result and the ultimate goal of this analysis.
It is the first such implementation of an inclusive radiative analysis at Belle~II.
Moreover, it is the first implementation of a hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma measurement since 2007, 
when the result was reported by the BaBar collaboration (see \Cref{tab:btosgamma_inclusive_summary}).
The results of the Belle~II analysis are available in \cite{Belle-II:2022hys}.

This final Chapter is dedicated to the discussion and overview of the results, as well as their significance.
The future of \BtoXsgamma, focusing on the hadronic-tagged measurements, is also discussed.
