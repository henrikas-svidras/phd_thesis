\chapter{Overview of the results and future prospects}\label{ch:overview}

The full analysis setup and the branching fraction measurement results in 
\Cref{sec:partial_branching_fraction_results,sec:total_branching_fraction_results}
are the final result and the ultimate goal of this analysis.
It is the first such implementation of an inclusive radiative analysis at Belle~II.
Moreover, it is the first implementation of a hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma measurement since 2007, 
when the result was reported by the BaBar collaboration (see \Cref{tab:btosgamma_inclusive_summary}).
The results of the Belle~II analysis are available in \cite{Belle-II:2022hys}.

This final Chapter is dedicated to the discussion and overview of the results, as well as their significance.
The prospects of \BtoXsgamma, focusing on the hadronic-tagged measurements, are also discussed.

\section{Discussion of the Belle~II hadronic-tagged \texorpdfstring{\BtoXsgamma}{B->Xs gamma} results}\label{sec:result_discussion}

The resulting values in \Cref{tab:integrated_branching_fractions} are in perfect agreement with the Standard Model values (see \Cref{sec:btosgamma_totalrate_theory}).
They also agree with the past measurements of \BtoXsgamma, which utilise both inclusive and sum-of-exclusive methods.
The visual comparison of all inclusive measurements is provided in \Cref{fig:measurement_comparison}.

The hadronic tagged \BtoXsgamma analysis is dominated statistically, with the systematic components lower, as seen in \Cref{tab:integrated_branching_fractions}.
The systematic uncertainty is larger than the statistical uncertainty only if the lowest-\EB signal-region interval is included in the integrated branching fraction evaluation, 
as the systematic uncertainty is driven by the number of background events in the post-fit sample.

Judging from the partial branching fractions of \BtoXsgamma in \Cref{sec:partial_branching_fraction_results},
the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty originates from background modelling.
This contribution drops off quickly as the number of background events decreases.
The \Mbc fitting model uncertainties also drop quickly with \EB, as the main fitting difficulties originate from the contamination of \Mbc distribution by peaking non-\BtoXsgamma events.
On the other hand, the uncertainties due to signal modelling and \BtoXdgamma increase with \EB, as the number of \BtoXsdgamma events grows.

As discussed in \Cref{sec:btosgamma_techniques}, different analysis procedures are complementary to each other.
Therefore, although individually the result is not competitive with the most precise measurements of BaBar and Belle (note that those measurements are performed with $2--3$ times larger datasets),
its results show important consistency between different measurement techniques.
Furthermore, it is a second-ever measurement of the hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma: therefore it serves as proof of the measurement technique and its applicability across different experimental setups.

Consider the hadronic-tagged measurement of BaBar \cite{BaBar:2007yhb} (extrapolated to 1.6~\gev), which obtains:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:babar_measurement}
    \mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma) = 3.90 \pm 0.91 \mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 0.64 \mathrm{(stat.)}.
\end{equation}
It is possible to compare this to the results of the analysis presented here (\Cref{tab:integrated_branching_fractions})
to see that the statistical uncertainty is ($0.91/0.80\approx1.14$) times lower.
The improvement of the statistical uncertainty is likely a combination of several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A higher tagging efficiency at Belle~II offered by the \FEI algorithm compared to the one used at BaBar (compare \FEI efficiency in \Cref{eq:tag_efficiency_with_uncertainty} with the 0.3\% reported in Ref.~\cite{BaBar:2007yhb});
    \item Different continuum suppression strategy (the Belle~II analysis uses a \BDT, whereas BaBar utilised a Fischer discriminant);
    \item Different fitting setup (the Belle~II analysis uses three \PDF{s}, whereas BaBar perform the fit using a Crystal Ball and ARGUS \PDF combination);
\end{itemize}
and others.

The systematic uncertainty highly depends on the lower-\EB energy threshold due to different components of the systematic uncertainty obtaining different importance.
Therefore, a meaningful comparison is only such where the \EB threshold is the same.
The value in \Cref{eq:babar_measurement} is evaluated with a threshold of $\EB>1.9~\gev$.
Assuming a linear shift of uncertainty, the result of the Belle II analysis presented here is averaged $0.5\cdot(0.52+0.86)\approx0.69$.
Therefore, the systematic uncertainty is slightly higher but comparable, which is consistent with the lower-\EB threshold setting.
Furthermore, the evaluated uncertainties leave room for improvement in the future as will be discussed in \Cref{sec:future_prospects}.

Finally, the measurement of \EB distribution moments agrees well with the world average values \cite{Workman:2022ynf}:
\begin{equation}
    \expval{\EB} = 2.314 \pm 0.011 ~\gev; \quad \expval{\EB^2} - \expval{\B}^2 = 0.303 \pm 0.0025.
\end{equation}
The uncertainties of the measured moments in \Cref{tab:moments} are several times larger than the world average values.
They contain a comparable significant statistical and systematic uncertainty component.

Interestingly, at higher-\EB thresholds (e.g. 2.1~\gev), while still larger, the systematic uncertainty is comparable to the total uncertainty of the world average.
Interpreting the uncertainties from the partial branching fraction measurement in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions} indicates that background and fit modelling uncertainties are large contributors to the systematic uncertainty at lower-\EB thresholds.
Therefore, for improved accuracies of the hadronic tagged measurement,
the upcoming larger Belle~II dataset will not be sufficient alone --
parameter estimation, background subtraction and modelling uncertainties have to be further studied.
The next section will discuss the anticipated prospects for this goal.

\section{Future prospects for hadronic-tagged \safeBtoXsgamma analysis at Belle~II}\label{sec:future_prospects}

Belle~II is an ongoing experiment, which means that more and more \epem collision data will be recorded in the next decade.
No other ongoing experiment can contribute to the inclusive radiative measurements.
As it is clear from \Cref{sec:results} and \Cref{sec:result_discussion}, at the moment the analysis is limited statistically.
With the larger Belle~II dataset, the importance of systematic effects will grow.
Although in this analysis several systematic uncertainties are set at their conservative estimates (see \Cref{sec:background_normalisation_systematic}, \Cref{sec:xdgamma_systematic} etc.),
additional studies will allow reducing them.
This was studied (as part of the original work for this thesis), and the results are available in \cite{Belle-II:2022cgf}.
The uncertainty projections for the hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma are summarised in \Cref{tab:btosgamma_projections}.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \caption{\label{tab:btosgamma_projections}
    The projected uncertainties for the hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma with the increased Belle~II data set size.
    These projections are evaluated assuming the principal contributions in systematic uncertainty arise from
    background modelling and suppression uncertainties.
    The baseline case is presented for a scenario where the remaining good background of good tag-\B mesons is known to $10\%$,
    whereas the improved scenario corresponds to where it is known to a $5\%$ accuracy.
    }
    \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
        \multirow{2}{*}{Lower \EB threshold} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Statistical uncertainty} & \multirow{2}{*}{\makecell{Baseline (improved)\\ systematic uncertainty}} \\
        & 1~\invab& 5~\invab & 10~\invab & 50~\invab & \\
        \hline
        1.4~\gev & 10.7\% & 6.4\% & 4.7\% & 2.2\% & 10.3 \% (5.2\%)\\
        1.6~\gev & 9.9 \% & 6.1\% & 4.5\% & 2.1\% & 8.5 \% (4.2\%)\\ 
        1.8~\gev & 9.3 \% & 5.7\% & 4.2\% & 2.0\% & 6.5 \% (3.2\%)\\ 
        2.0~\gev & 8.3 \% & 5.1\% & 3.8\% & 1.7\% & 3.7 \% (1.8\%)\\ 
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The statistical uncertainties for the hadronic tagged \BtoXsgamma are expected to reach $5\%$ level with $5~\invab$ of Belle~II data.
The systematic uncertainty expectations are evaluated assuming that the main contributor to the systematic uncertainty
is the remaining-\BB background subtraction and \FEI tagging.
If the knowledge of remaining-\BB background stays at the 10\% level ($8.7\%$ evaluated in this analysis) and \FEI calibration uncertainty is not improved,
it is expected that a 6.5\% total systematic uncertainty on the branching fraction of \BtoXsgamma can be achieved.
On the other hand, if remaining after-fit \BB backgrounds are understood to a $5\%$ level it is plausible half the expected systematic uncertainty.
The uncertainties on signal selection efficiency will further reduce as the understanding of background suppression tools (e.g. the \piz veto, \ZMVA) improves.
The \BtoXdgamma in the future will be accurately subtracted when precise \BtoXdgamma measurements with Belle~II are performed.


Summarising, world-leading hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma measurements with Belle~II datasets of $1-5~\invab$ are possible if remaining background contributions are understood to a 5\% or higher precision.
This is an important observation given the fact that other types of inclusive \BtoXsgamma analysis techniques are already systematically limited (see \Cref{tab:btosgamma_inclusive_summary}) with the Belle and BaBar datasets.
Therefore, a different approach, one that will be provided by the hadronic-tagged analyses, is necessary for further insights into the radiative \BtoXsgamma transitions.
In the shorter term, as Belle has not reported a hadronic-tagged \BtoXsgamma analysis, a joint Belle and Belle~II may provide a total dataset of approximately $1\invab$, making such results achievable in the next couple of years.

\section{Input of the results to theoretical averages}\label{sec:input_to_theory}

In a collaborative effort with the SIMBA collaboration, the results of \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions}
have been used to evaluate the $m_b$ and $\lambda_1$ and the $\mathcal{C}_7^{incl}$ parameters (see \Cref{sec:btosgamma_spectrum_theory}). 
A simultaneous parameter estimation fit of all available experimental results of the photon energy spectrum that include
BaBar and Belle results of hadronic, sum-of-exclusive, lepton-tagged measurement strategies are performed.
In this case, the Belle II result is also included.

The fit result and the comparison of the effect on the total value of the evaluated parameters are shown in \Cref{fig:simba_c7}.
Note that the $\EB\in(1.8,2.0)$ interval is excluded from the fit due to large uncertainty and differences in the interval widths compared to earlier \BtoXsgamma measurements.
The results slightly shift the central values of the parameters but the overall result retains a similar uncertainty and is consistent with the earlier results.

    \Cref{fig:c7} show the corresponding $|C_7V_{tb}V^*_{ts}|$ and $m_b^{1S}$ values.
    The dark line (default) corresponds to the result without the Belle II results, whereas the red curve demonstrates the result with Belle II results included.
    As expected, due to the current low statistical precision of the \BtoXsgamma measurement the effect is small.

With the new inputs from Belle II, the determined SIMBA values are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:new_simba_values}
    m_b^{1S}= 4.748\pm0.043~\gevcc; \quad \lambda_1 = -0.219\pm0.082~\gev^2/c^4,
\end{equation}
The results can be directly compared with the previous values from SIMBA given in \Cref{eq:simba_result}.
The uncertainties for both values, as before, combine fitting, theoretical and parametric components.
The latter two are assumed to not change when evaluating the total uncertainty.
