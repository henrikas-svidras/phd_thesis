\chapter{Measurement of \safeBtoXsgamma with hadronic-tagging}

So far the thesis laid out the theoretical foundation which motivates the study of \BtoXsgamma 
and experimental techniques which allow to perform this measurement.
In this Chapter, the two will be connected, describing the main topic of the PhD thesis: 
a measurement of the photon-energy spectrum of \BtoXsgamma decays using the hadronic-tagging technique,
with the Belle II data.
This measurement is the first such measurement in Belle II, and generally, since the previously discussed BaBar result \cite{BaBar:2007yhb}.
It sets up the experimental procedure for the Belle II experiments following this analysis technique in the future.

The measurement is performed in several (interconnected) steps, which are broken down in REFHERE\todo{ref here}.
The implication of the results and the outlook for the analysis will be discussed in the following chapter CHAPTER NAME.

It begins with a discussion of the input data samples and simulated samples.
I then present the strategy for primary event-selection and reconstruction.
After this, a more thorough event-selection and background-suppression is discussed.
The implementation of the fitting-procedure on simulated data follows.
Lastly, the spectrum is extracted by the subtraction of remaining background processes.
