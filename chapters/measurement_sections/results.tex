All the discussion thus far involved either \MC samples, Belle~II data samples with a negligible amount of \BtoXsgamma events,
or with the signal region ($\EB\in(1.8,2.7)~\gev$) hidden.
After designing the analysis with simulation, performing extensive validation and evaluating systematic uncertainties, 
the signal region is ready to be unblinded, as it was shown that no significant biases are expected.
This Section presents the main results of the unblinded analysis.
The discussion related to them, their interpretation and future prospects for \BtoXsgamma are discussed in \Cref{ch:overview}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Mbc}{Mbc} fit results}\label{sec:mbc_fit_results}

Following the \Mbc fitting strategy described in \Cref{sec:fitting_setup} and the model in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params_updated},
the fits on the signal region of Belle~II data are performed.
They are shown in \Cref{fig:data_fits_signal}.
Together with fits in \Cref{fig:sideband_data_fit}, this gives all the data fits for the \EB intervals defined in \Cref{sec:binning}.
The extracted $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}$ are shown in the top right corner of each Figure.

The number of good tag-\B events, evaluated from fits in Belle~II data (\Cref{fig:sideband_data_fit,fig:data_fits_signal}),
are summarised in \Cref{fig:final_fit_results}.
The Figure also includes results from fits on Belle~II \MC with all \BtoXsgamma events removed (\Cref{fig:sideband_mc_fit,fig:nosignal_fits_signal}).
The latter provides the expectations of \BB backgrounds that remain in Belle~II data after the fit.
The \MC is corrected as discussed in \Cref{sec:corrections}, with appropriate uncertainties from \Cref{sec:systematic_uncertainty} included.
The \Cref{fig:final_fit_results_lin} shows the $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}$ in linear scale, which makes the comparison of low-\EB region easier. 
In this region, the number of signal events is expected to be much larger than any contribution from \BtoXsgamma events.
On the other hand, \Cref{fig:final_fit_results_log} shows the results in a logarithmic axis, which makes it evident that an excess over the remaining \BB background is present.
This excess in data is evidence of \BtoXsdgamma events.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Remaining-\texorpdfstring{\BB}{BB} background subtraction results}\label{sec:background_subtraction_results}

The excess observed in Belle~II data fits over background-only Belle~II simulation fits is attributed to the presence of \BtoXsdgamma events.
Following the background subtraction strategy shown in \Cref{sec:background_subtraction,sec:background_subtraction_validation_mc},
the remaining good tag-\B meson backgrounds are subtracted.
This corresponds to the subtraction of the filled (green) histogram from data points in \Cref{fig:final_fit_results}.
Within uncertainties, the resulting difference is attributed to photons that originate in \BtoXsdgamma decays.
The background-subtracted photon energy spectrum is shown in \Cref{fig:subtracted_results}.
\begin{figure}[hbtp!]
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:subtracted_spectrum}}{

    \caption{\label{fig:subtracted_results}
        The counts of events consistent with radiative decays extracted from the fitted Belle~II data after subtracting the remaining non-\BtoXsdgamma background,
        based on results summarised in \Cref{fig:final_fit_results}.
        The total uncertainty includes background subtraction and fitting uncertainties, without efficiency corrections or unfolding.
        The data points are overlaid with the simulated expectation which shows the hybrid-signal model, defined in \Cref{sec:signal_model}.
        All data points, including the sideband region, are shown in (\subref{fig:subtracted_spectrum}).
        On the other hand, (\subref{fig:subtracted_spectrum_signal_region}) focuses only on the signal region.
        The legend is shared for both Figures.
    }
\end{figure}

The background-subtracted photon energy spectrum includes all systematic uncertainties related 
to background subtraction (\Cref{sec:background_uncertainties})
and fitting uncertainties (\Cref{sec:fit_uncertainties}).
The results agree very well with the simulated expectation from the hybrid-signal model.
The pulls (see \Cref{eq:pull_distribution}) are calculated with respect to the hybrid-signal model expectation are evaluated 
and show that all the measured data points agree with the expectation within $1$ to $2\sigma$.

The measured number of events for the signal region in each \EB interval, as well as a cumulative count are given in \Cref{tab:observed_events}.
The statistical and total uncertainties are depicted separately.
The cumulative count is performed starting at the high-\EB intervals and cumulatively adding the contributions from lower \EB intervals (with systematic uncertainties summed appropriately to their correlation).
This is done because the low end of the \EB spectrum has the highest uncertainties and the smallest precision.
Using \Cref{eq:btodgamma_subtraction}, the \BtoXsdgamma counts are transformed to \BtoXsgamma event counts.
The cumulative and binned results show excellent agreement with the expectation of the hybrid-signal model.

\begin{table}[hbtp!]
    \caption{\label{tab:observed_events}

    The second half of the Table shows the cumulative observed number of events (the summation is done from high-\EB, where uncertainties are lower).
    The transformation between \BtoXsdgamma and \BtoXsgamma is performed using the relation in \Cref{eq:btodgamma_subtraction}.
    The expected number of \BtoXsgamma events is provided based on the central values of the hybrid-signal model.
    All results are consistent with the expectations.

\subsection{Partial branching fraction measurement results}\label{sec:partial_branching_fraction_results}

The measurement results, provided in \Cref{tab:observed_events} and visualised in \Cref{fig:subtracted_spectrum},
are used to calculate the partial branching fractions of \BtoXsgamma decays.
To this end, observed \mbox{\BtoXsgamma} events are corrected for efficiency and unfolded.
The efficiency used for the calculations is provided in \Cref{sec:signal_selection_uncertainties}, 
whereas the unfolding factors and strategy are described in \Cref{sec:unfolding_systematic}.
Note that up until now \EB and $\tilde{E}_{\gamma}^B$ were used to explicitly differentiate
the measured and the true (unfolded) photon energy, respectively.
\textit{In the following Sections only} the \EB notation is used to denote the unfolded photon energy (i.e. the tilde notation is omitted).

Combining all the results presented in this thesis leads to the following form of \Cref{eq:branching_fraction_recipe} for the partial branching fraction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:branching_fraction}
    \frac{\Delta\mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma)_i}{\Delta {E^B_{\g}}_{,i}} = \frac{\mathcal{U}_i\cdot\left(\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{DATA}}_{\mathrm{CB},i} - 
                                                                              \mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{non-}\BtoXsdgamma}_{\mathrm{CB},i} - 
                                                                              N_i^{\BtoXdgamma}\right)}
                                                         {\varepsilon_i \cdot N_B},
\end{equation}
where (left to right, top to bottom):
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i$ is a given \EB interval;
    \item $\mathcal{U}_i$ is an unfolding factor for interval $i$, based on \Cref{tab:unfolding_uncertainties};
    \item $\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{DATA}}_{\mathrm{CB},i}$ is the number of good tag-\B mesons in Belle~II data for interval $i$.
    These values are given in \Cref{tab:observed_events};
    \item $\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{non-}\BtoXsgamma}_{\mathrm{CB},i}$ is the number of good tag-\B meson candidates where the signal \B meson does not decay as \BtoXsdgamma, evaluated in Belle~II simulation (corrected for differences in luminosity and modelling) for an interval $i$.
    These values are given in \Cref{tab:background_uncertainties};
    \item $N_i^{\BtoXdgamma}$ is the number of \BtoXdgamma events contributing to an interval $i$;
    \item $\varepsilon_i$ is the factorised signal efficiency for interval $i$, defined in \Cref{eq:factorisable_signal_efficiency}; 
    with values taken from \Cref{tab:signal_selection_uncertainties} and \Cref{eq:tag_efficiency_with_uncertainty};
    \item $N_B$ is the number of $B$ mesons in the analysed Belle~II data sample, as given in \Cref{eq:b_meson_count}.
\end{itemize}

The results of the calculations based on \Cref{eq:branching_fraction} with all 
results discussed and derived in this thesis are shown in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions}.
The statistical and systematic uncertainties are included, where the latter is broken down into four categories presented in \Cref{sec:systematic_uncertainty}.
The calculations are only performed for the signal region $\EB\in(1.8,2.7)~\gev$ where the unfolding factors are available.
Furthermore, the $\EB\in(2.6,2.7)~\gev$ interval is not given in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions}, 
because the corresponding unfolding factor is zero (see \Cref{tab:unfolding_uncertainties}).

\begin{table}[hbtp!]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{tab:partial_branching_fractions}
    Results of the partial branching fraction measurement presented in this thesis, based on \Cref{eq:branching_fraction}. 
    The first part of the Table shows the partial branching fractions for each \EB interval, their statistical and systematic uncertainty components.
    The second part of the Table shows the breakdown of the systematic uncertainty into groups that are defined in \Cref{sec:systematic_uncertainty}. 
    Statistical uncertainties remain the dominant component in the analysis.
    Note that signal efficiency and background modelling uncertainties are correlated due to the same correction factors used (see \Cref{sec:corrections}).
    }
    \input{tables/partial_branching_fractions.tex}
\end{table}

Comparing the systematic and statistical uncertainties, the results in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions} 
are largely statistically dominated in all \EB intervals.
Although the statistical uncertainty dominates, the systematic uncertainty is more comparable in high-\EB intervals.
Generally, background and fit modelling uncertainties are the dominant systematic effect in the low-\EB region.
On the other hand, signal selection modelling and unfolding uncertainties become dominant at high-\EB.
These observations are consistent with the fact that the signal-to-background ratio grows with decreasing \EB (as seen in e.g. \Cref{tab:expected_events}),
and the fact that the number of \BtoXsgamma events is larger at higher \EB values.

The systematic uncertainties in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions} are correlated:
both between different systematic uncertainty groups (i.e. signal selection efficiency and background modelling)
and between different \EB bins.
These correlations, as discussed in \Cref{sec:systematic_uncertainty}, are combined and evaluated.
The correlation matrix is shown in \Cref{fig:correlation_uncertainty_matrix}.
The statistical and systematic component is merged here.
As the results have a large statistical uncertainty component, the correlation of uncertainties is found to be low.

    The inner error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty, whereas the outer ones to the total.
    The measurement results are overlaid with the expectations for the hybrid-signal model, and the associated uncertainty to it, evaluated in \Cref{sec:signal_model}.
    The data results show excellent agreement with the model.
    The correlation matrix of the partial branching fraction total uncertainties is shown in (\subref{fig:correlation_uncertainty_matrix}).
    }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Total branching fraction measurement results}\label{sec:total_branching_fraction_results}

As the measurement employs a selection of $\EB>1.4~\gev$, the full $\mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma)$ cannot be measured.
Furthermore, the $\EB\in(1.4,1.8)~\gev$ range has a large systematic and statistical uncertainty component.
Therefore, only an evaluation in the $\EB\in(1.8,2.6)~\gev$ interval from experimental data is feasible.
The results for thresholds of $1.8~\gev$, $2.0~\gev$ and $2.1~\gev$ are given in \Cref{tab:integrated_branching_fractions}.
The combined value of the correlated systematic uncertainties becomes dominant at the low-\EB threshold but remains comparable to the statistical uncertainty.

To compare with the results of other experiments and theoretical values,
the theoretical extrapolation factors are used, as provided in Ref.~\cite{Buchmuller:2005zv},
to evaluate the branching fraction at the threshold of $\EB>1.6~\gev$.
As it was discussed in \Cref{sec:btosgamma_totalrate_theory}, for \BtoXsgamma total rate evaluation, $\EB>1.6~\gev$ is a conventionally chosen threshold.
The extrapolated results are also provided in the last column of \Cref{tab:integrated_branching_fractions}.
Note that such extrapolation is model-dependent and cannot replace accurate measurements with a lower threshold.

\begin{table}[hbtp!]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{tab:integrated_branching_fractions}
    The integrated \BtoXsgamma branching fractions for different low-\EB thresholds measured with $189~\invfb$ of Belle~II data.
    They are evaluated by summing the partial branching fractions in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions}.
    The systematic and statistical uncertainties are denoted in the brackets.
    }
    \input{tables/total_branching_fractions.tex}
\end{table}

\footnotetext[1]{The extrapolation factor is not provided for the $\EB=2.1~\gev$ threshold in \cite{Buchmuller:2005zv}.
                This result is evaluated by extrapolating linearly and assuming a monotonic increase in uncertainty.
                This results in an extrapolation factor of $0.870\pm0.024$. 
                The number should be interpreted with the aforementioned caveats in mind only.}


\subsection{Moments of the \safeBtoXsgamma photon energy spectrum}\label{sec:spectrum_moments}

As discussed in \Cref{sec:btosgamma_totalrate_theory,sec:btosgamma_spectrum_theory} the moments of the \BtoXsgamma
spectrum are important for the understanding of \BtoXsgamma decay properties.
The first and second moments of the \BtoXsgamma spectrum are calculated based on the results in \Cref{tab:partial_branching_fractions}.
They are approximated as a weighted sum of the centre value of \EB intervals, $\Delta\EB$,
with weights corresponding to the partial branching fractions in that \EB interval:
\begin{align}\label{eq:weighted_sum_moments}
    \begin{split}
        \expval{\EB} &= \frac{\sum_i f_c(\Delta\EB^{}_{,i})\cdot  
                               \frac{\Delta\mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma)_i}
                                    {\Delta {E^B_{\g}}_{,i}}}
                             {\sum_i \frac{\Delta\mathcal{B}(\BtoXsgamma)_i}{\Delta {E^B_{\g}}_{,i}}},
    \end{split}
\end{align} 
where $f_c$ is used as a loose notation for a function that returns the central point of an interval.
The calculated values of the first and second moments of \EB for different lower thresholds are given in \Cref{tab:moments}.
The systematic and statistical uncertainty sources match those in earlier Subsections, and their correlation is accounted for as discussed before.

% Note that the results strongly depend on the threshold -- particularly for the second moment.
The measured values of the first moment in \Cref{tab:moments} (average of the photon energy spectrum) slightly decrease with the \EB threshold.
The total uncertainty changes from 2\% to 4\% as the \EB lower threshold decreases from 2.1~\gev to 1.8~\gev.
On the other hand, the second moment (the variance of the spectrum) highly depends on the threshold chosen.
The uncertainties grow swiftly with a decreasing \EB threshold.
While the uncertainty with a $\EB=2.0~\gev$ threshold is at 25\%, this increases to 46\% at 1.8~\gev.
A larger uncertainty is attributed to the fact that the dispersion of the possible \EB energies highly depends on a precise measurement of the tail.
Conversely, in the case of the first moment, the peak region carries the highest importance.
