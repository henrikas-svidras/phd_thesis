All discussion so far involved either simulated samples, Belle~II data samples with \BtoXsgamma events negligible,
or with the signal region ($\EB\in(1.8,2.7)~\gev$) hidden.
After setting up the analysis on simulation, performing extensive validation and evaluating systematic uncertainties, 
the signal region is ready to be unblinded, as it was shown that no biases are expected.
This section presents the results of the analysis.
