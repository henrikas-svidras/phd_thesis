Up until now the discussion of the analysis revolved around \MC studies.
The full analysis procedure on simulation is defined and shown to produce an unbiased, stable result in \Cref{sec:MC_validation}.
Then, \Cref{sec:corrections} looked at the corrections required to accurately correct differences expected in simulation to better represent data.
At this stage, all appropriate measures have been taken and the analysis can be fully applied to Belle II data.
The concepts of a blinded analysis, however, dictate that to ensure no biases are present, the full analysis procedure must be performed in validation samples.
For the \BtoXsgamma analysis, four validation samples are defined:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \epem\ra\qqbar sample that contains collision data collected 60~\mev below the \FourS centre-of-mass energy.
    \item Sample with an enhanced \epem\ra\qqbar component, where the \texttt{BDT~output} score requirement is inverted: $\mathtt{BDT~output}<0.4$.
    \item Sample with an enhanced \BB background component, where the $\piz$ and $\eta$ veto requirements are inverted.
    \item Sideband $\EB\in(1.4,1.8)~\gev$, where the signal-to-background ratio is small, and \mbox{$2.7<\EB~\gev$}, where the signal is kinematically forbidden, respectively.
    Note that some signal events may still be present in the latter due to resolution effects, but they are not expected to be statistically significant.
\end{itemize}
In this Section, the analysis selections, \Mbc fitting and leftover-\BB background subtraction are investigated thoroughly using these samples.

\subsection{Validation on the \texorpdfstring{\epem\ra\qqbar}{e+e- -> qqbar} off-resonance sample}\label{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation}

The validation on \epem\ra\qqbar events is performed using only \epem\ra\qqbar simulation.
The goal of this validation is to ensure that continuum backgrounds are described by the simulated samples correctly.
Although \Cref{sec:continuum_validation} partially ensures this, only the distribution shape requirements are tested there.
Furthermore, the best candidate selection, which was developed on \BB samples, may change the conclusions that were found earlier.

All the corrections for \piz and $\eta$ veto, \FEI calibrations are applied as discussed in \Cref{sec:corrections}.
Full analysis selection procedure involving the most optimal selections and the best tag-side candidate selection is applied, as presented in \Cref{sec:selection_summary,sec:select_best_candidate}.
The resulting continuum-only \EB distributions are shown in \Cref{fig:offresonance_validation}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    Excellent agreement is observed in \feiBp (\Cref{fig:bplus_offresonance_eb}), \feiBz (\Cref{fig:bzero_offresonance_eb})
    and the combined sample (\Cref{fig:bboth_offresonance_eb}).
    The uncertainty for data contains only the statistical component.
    The simulation uncertainty contains statistical and systematic uncertainties corresponding to \Cref{tab:correction_table}.
    }
\end{figure}

Overall, the agreement between continuum data and simulation is excellent.
Due to the rather low size of the off-resonance data sample and the strong continuum suppression in this analysis, the statistical uncertainty is relatively large.
It is concluded that the \EB distribution of \epem\ra\qqbar events is well-modelled in simulation and follows the expectations seen in earlier Sections.

Due to known issues with beam energy values in the off-resonance data, which affect the \Mbc calculation (but not the overall validity of other values), 
the \epem\ra\qqbar off-resonance \Mbc distributions do not accurately represent the \Mbc values of continuum events.
Therefore, these samples are not used for \Mbc distribution and \Mbc fitting validation.

\subsection{Validation on \texorpdfstring{\epem\ra\qqbar}{e+e- -> qqbar} enhanced sample}\label{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}

As it was mentioned in \Cref{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation},
the continuum data samples were not used to validate the \Mbc fitting.
However, an alternative validation sample is prepared, where the continuum component is enhanced.
This is achieved by inverting the \texttt{BDT~output} selection (see \Cref{sec:continuum_suppression}) thereby suppressing \BB events.
To ensure a minimal amount of \BtoXsgamma events in the sample (as the \texttt{BDT~output} is not perfectly efficient), here \piVeto and \etaVeto
are also inverted.
This creates a sample with mostly \epem\ra\qqbar events and small components of \BB events.
The inverted values are chosen as $\mathtt{BDT~output}<0.2$ and $\piVeto>0.4$ and $\etaVeto>0.4$.
The resulting \EB spectra for both \FEI modes are shown in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_eb_validation}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:bplus_qqbar_enhanced_eb}}{

    and the combined sample (\Cref{fig:bboth_offresonance_eb}).
    The uncertainty for data contains only the statistical component.
    The simulation uncertainty contains statistical and systematic uncertainties corresponding to \Cref{tab:correction_table}.
    }
\end{figure}

Although the agreement is generally adequate, particularly in the signal region, a small excess of events is observed in the low-\EB region.
Similarly, the resulting \Mbc distributions are shown in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbc}.
A striking difference from the generally good agreement observed so far can be seen for \feiBp, \feiBz and the combined sample.
A larger amount of continuum events, particularly at low-\Mbc, is present.
Moreover, the upper threshold of the \Mbc is shifted.
The overall data-to-simulation discrepancy is as high as 20\%.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:Bplus_qqbar_enhanced_mbc}}{

    \caption{\label{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbc}
    The \Mbc distribution of \qqbar enhanced samples (see \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}).
    Some clear differences in \feiBp (\Cref{fig:Bplus_qqbar_enhanced_mbc}), \feiBz (\Cref{fig:Bzero_qqbar_enhanced_mbc}),
    and the combined sample (\Cref{fig:Bboth_qqbar_enhanced_mbc}) can be observed.
    Particularly, it is evident that there are more continuum events at low-\Mbc.
    The \Mbc high-endpoint is shifted to lower values.
    These results motivate the modification of the \Mbc fitting procedure, 
    summarised in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params_updated}.
    }
\end{figure}

These differences are understood as a result of two reasons related to the fact that data-taking period independent simulation is used in this analysis.
In normal data collection conditions $\sqrt{s}$ is not perfectly stable: minute variations or drifts can occur over time.
The data-taking period independent simulation does not account for these changes, where the collision energy is simply set to a predetermined average value.
The \Mbc endpoint is directly affected by the $\sqrt{s}$, as seen in \Cref{eq:mbc_exclusive}, with lower values of $\sqrt{s}$ pushing the \Mbc threshold lower.
On the other hand, a larger overall amount of \qqbar events is understood as a consequence of the fact that collecting the data at lower collision energies (but not lower than \FourS energy) enhances the \mbox{\epem\ra\qqbar} process cross-section.
Altogether, this leads to more continuum events present in the data sample than predicted by the data-taking period independent simulation.

For good tag-\B mesons, the shift would not occur.
This is a result of the fact that $p_B^*$ (as seen in \Cref{eq:mbc_exclusive}) is directly related to the total energy of the collision.
The resonant-like behaviour in \Mbc is driven by the \B meson mass and therefore for correctly reconstructed objects is valid irrespective of $\sqrt{s}$. 
Such constraints are not present for misreconstructed events, therefore, the shifts are expected to happen there.

Although the most robust solution is the usage of data-taking period dependent simulation, at the time of preparation of this analysis such simulation was not yet available at Belle II.
While future studies will be able to rely on it, in this analysis additional steps were taken to account for for the lack of it.

While \Mbc is strongly affected, the \EB spectrum is still well-described.
This is a consequence of the fact that \EB does not depend as strongly on $\sqrt{s}$ as \Mbc.
Therefore, a correction is only necessary for the \Mbc distribution \textit{and} only for combinatorial \BB and continuum events.
An \textit{ad hoc} approach is developed, where the \Mbc distribution for \MC events is shifted manually. 
The procedure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Count the frequencies of each $\sqrt{s}$ value occurring in the Belle II on-resonance dataset;
    \item Randomly remove half of the beam energies in the simulated Belle II dataset of \textit{events where no good tag-\B mesons are present};
    \item Replace the removed beam energies with the values of the first step, based on the frequencies they occur at in the Belle~II on-resonance dataset.
\end{itemize}
Only $50\%$ of energies are replaced to minimise any potential conscious bias that such a procedure could introduce.
Note that the replacement of $\sqrt{s}$ only affects the \Mbc calculation and not other observables which may rely on $\sqrt{s}$ in their definition.
The result of the correction on the \Mbc distribution of the sample of both \FEI modes combined is shown in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/data_validation/Bboth_qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected} The \Mbc distribution of \qqbar enhanced samples (see \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}),
    where an \Mbc correction has been applied to the simulated distribution.
    Although the correction does not perfectly align the distributions, the signal region ($\Mbc\approx5.28~\gevcc$) is described correctly.}
\end{figure}
Although a perfect agreement is not achieved via the \textit{ad hoc} correction, the peak region has an overall better description. 
This is evident when comparing \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected} and \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbc}.

A key point to discuss here is the effect the different \Mbc shape may have on the \Mbc fitter.
The differences in the tail and the end-point are expected to not strongly affect the result because the \Mbc fitter is prepared with shape differences in mind (see \Cref{sec:fitting_setup}).
However, the initial parameters of the \Mbc fitter in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params} have to be updated to emphasise that a different corrected-\Mbc is the new fitting observable.
The \Mbc fitter is therefore updated, following the same procedures as \Cref{sec:fitting_setup} and the new values are given in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params_updated}.
\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{tab:fitting_init_params_updated} The summary of the \Mbc fitting model used in this analysis after updating the fitting variable to the corrected-\Mbc.
    The parameters are initialised at the values that are listed, corresponding to the ones determined in the primary fitting steps, explained in \Cref{sec:crystal_ball_prefit,sec:chebyshev_prefit,sec:argus_prefit}, with \Mbc replaced by a `corrected'-\Mbc value.
    The values that are bolded in the Table are not estimated from the final corrected-\Mbc fit but are kept at their initialised values.
    On the other hand, all non-bolded values can vary in the final fitter.
    Uncertainties are evaluated using the \texttt{HESSE} method in the primary fitting steps.
    They are omitted if the relative uncertainty is lower than $0.1\%$.
    }
    \input{tables/fit_model_updated.tex}
\end{table}

This fitter is applied to the continuum-enhanced samples of Belle~II data used in this analysis,
and the  fitted \Mbc distributions are shown in \Cref{fig:mbc_qqbar_ehnhanced_fits}.
The Figures also contain the number of good tag-\B mesons that are estimated by the fitter.
It can be seen that no statistically significant peak in \Mbc is extracted.
Therefore it can be concluded that the validation of the \Mbc fitter is successful: enough flexibility is seen
to describe the slight difference in \Mbc shapes between \MC and real data, without introducing a bias to the extracted number of good tag-\B mesons.

\subsection{Validation on \texorpdfstring{\BB}{BB}-background enhanced sample}\label{sec:bb_background_validation}

In the last Section, the validation on a sample with \epem\ra\qqbar events was performed.
Another important validation given the background subtraction step (\Cref{sec:background_subtraction}),
is the \BB background description in \MC.

Firstly, a \BB-background enhanced sample is prepared.
This is done in almost the same manner as \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}, except with the continuum suppression requirement unchanged from the optimal selection.
In this case, only the \piVeto and \etaVeto selections are inverted.
The selections are chosen as $\piVeto>0.6$ and $\etaVeto>0.6$, as these selections ensure that the signal-to-background ratio is less than 0.1\%.
As the selections are inverted, so must the corrections that account for them be modified (\Cref{tab:correction_table}).
In particular, the corresponding corrections for the \piVeto and \etaVeto are transformed as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correction_transform}
    \mathrm{Corr}_{>0.x} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Corr_{<0.x}}}; \quad \sigma(\mathrm{Corr}_{>0.x}) =  \frac{1}{\mathrm{Corr_{<0.x}}^2} \times \sigma(\mathrm{Corr}_{<0.x}).
\end{equation}

The \EB distribution of the \BB-enhanced sample is shown in \Cref{fig:bbbar_enhanced_eb}.
Overall, the distributions show excellent agreement between data and simulation.
The previously seen discrepancy in normalisation (see \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_eb_validation}) is no longer apparent.
This can be interpreted based on the fact that \epem\ra\qqbar events are strongly suppressed, namely 
by the requirements of \texttt{BDT~output}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:Bplus_bbbar_enhanced_eb}}{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/data_validation/Bplus_bbbar_enhanced_eb.pdf}

    }
    \caption{\label{fig:bbbar_enhanced_eb} The \EB distribution of \BB-background enhanced samples (see \Cref{sec:bb_background_validation}).
    Compared to \Cref{fig:bboth_offresonance_eb}, it is clear that the \BB background drops off faster with increasing \EB than \epem\ra\qqbar.
    Overall, the data-simulation agreement is excellent and this is attributed to the fact that continuum events, which were accredited to causing a discrepancy in \Cref{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation}, are highly suppressed in the \BB-background enhanced sample.
    }
\end{figure}

Following the observations in \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}, similar modifications to \Mbc are necessary here, too.
The corrected-\Mbc distribution is shown in \Cref{fig:bbbar_enhanced_mbccorrected}.
The results are shown for the combined \feiBp and \feiBz sample only, although the individual \FEI modes also show similar results.
In particular, one can see that the agreement between data and simulation is closer than what was observed in \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}.
This goes in line with the previous statements that \epem\ra\qqbar modelling was related to the discrepancies observed so far, which are not strongly pronounced here due to their suppression.
Observing the pull distribution in \Cref{fig:bbbar_enhanced_mbccorrected} it is clear that, generally, fewer events seem to be present in the peak region and more in the tail region.
Again, this is in line with the expectation: the variations of $\sqrt{s}$ in real data modify the \BB-production and \epem\ra\qqbar cross-sections.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/data_validation/Bboth_bbbar_enhanced_mbccorrected.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:bbbar_enhanced_mbccorrected} The \Mbc distribution of \BB-background enhanced samples (see \Cref{sec:bb_background_validation}),
    where an \Mbc correction has been applied to the simulated distribution.
    Only the \feiBp and \feiBz combined sample is shown, but the individual ones show similar results.
    Due to a lower number of \epem\ra\qqbar events, the low-\Mbc region disagreement is less pronounced than in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected}.
    }
\end{figure}

Finally, a fit of the \BB-enhanced performed of the \Mbc distributions, according to the modified \Mbc fitter model in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params_updated}.
Unlike in \Cref{fig:mbc_qqbar_ehnhanced_fits}, the number of expected-\BB events is no longer expected to be negligible.
Therefore, this validation serves as a test of fit-bias and background-subtraction procedure.
The fits on Belle II simulation are shown in \Cref{fig:mbc_bbar_ehnhanced_fits_mc}, whereas the fits on Belle II data \Cref{fig:mbc_bbar_ehnhanced_fits_data}.
The figures also show the extracted good tag-\B meson counts as normalisations of the Crystal Ball \PDF, $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}$.

Despite a vastly varying number of events and shapes of the total distribution throughout different \EB intervals,
the fitter performs well.
The extracted $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}^{\mathrm{DATA}}$ $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ (corresponding to good tag-\B meson yields in data and simulation, respectively)
are directly compared.
Correcting the simulation based on \Cref{tab:correction_table} (with inverted \piVeto and \etaVeto correction as shown in \Cref{eq:correction_transform}) and calculating the difference between the two is expected to yield a value consistent with zero.
The resulting difference, with appropriate statistical and correction uncertainties applied, is shown in \Cref{fig:bbar_enhanced_background_subtraction}.
The hypothesised result is observed, confirming the adequacy of the fitter, the validity of the background subtraction procedure and the applied corrections.

\subsection{Validation outside of the \texorpdfstring{\EB}{EB} signal-region}\label{sec:sidebands_validation}

In \Cref{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation,sec:continuum_mbc_validation,sec:bb_background_validation} it was seen that the background simulation of \qqbar and \BB events,
although not perfect, is described adequately by the \Mbc fitter yielding a correct and valid estimation of good tag-\B mesons in data and simulation.
The last validation performed for background simulation is done outside of the \EB signal region.
As discussed in \Cref{sec:binning}, the $\EB\in(1.4-1.8)~\gev$ and $2.7<\EB~\gev$ intervals were selected as sideband regions, 
due to a small number of \BtoXsgamma events and a low signal-to-background ratio expected there.
The same argumentation makes the regions excellent for background validation.

The \EB distribution for the three \EB sideband intervals is shown in \Cref{fig:sidebands_eb}.
A striking difference in normalisation of nearly 20\% is observed, 
which seems similar to that observed in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_eb_validation}.
Interestingly, here, the \epem\ra\qqbar component is thought to be strongly suppressed by \texttt{BDT~output}.
To better understand this discrepancy, the corrected-\Mbc distributions in each \EB sideband bin are inspected.
This is shown in \Cref{fig:sidebands_mbc}.

    The \Mbc distribution of the \EB sideband regions (see \Cref{sec:sidebands_validation}).
    The figures showcase different \EB ranges, as indicated in the right corner of each Figure.
    Interestingly, a similar low-\Mbc discrepancy is observed with the enhanced-continuum sample, shown in \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbc}.
    }
\end{figure}

The results of \Cref{fig:sidebands_eb,fig:sidebands_mbc} indicate that Belle~II data, especially the low-\Mbc region, has a clear excess compared to simulation.
While some discrepancy is expected considering the results of \Cref{fig:qqbar_enhanced_mbccorrected},
the larger scale of the discrepancy is confusing -- given the fact that this was not observed in \Cref{fig:bbbar_enhanced_mbccorrected}.
Although more studies on this subject are necessary to fully understand the discrepancy, 
it is attributed to a \BB-background component which is not well modelled in Belle~II simulation, the potential origin of which is shortly discussed here.

In particular, consider the removal of \texttt{zernikeMVA} selection.
The resulting \EB sideband distribution and the \Mbc distribution are shown in \Cref{fig:nozmva_test}.
In this case, the agreement between data and simulation in the \EB-sideband spectrum appears to be near-perfect, as seen in \Cref{fig:sideband_eb_nozmva}.
Indeed, even considering the \Mbc distribution for $\EB\in(1.4,1.6)~\gev$ in \Cref{fig:sideband_mbc_nozmva}, one clearly observes a better overall-agreement.
These observations strongly support the previous hypothesis that a hadronic cluster is not well-modelled in simulation.
The component cannot be common to \epem\ra\qqbar events, because the effect was not seen in off-resonance data in \Cref{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation}.
As a result, this component is suppressed in Belle~II simulation by a selection on the \texttt{zernikeMVA} observable, but this does happen in Belle~II data.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:sideband_eb_nozmva}}{

    \caption{\label{fig:nozmva_test}   The \EB distributions in the \EB sideband region (\Cref{fig:sideband_eb_nozmva})

    \Cref{fig:zmva_discrepancy} is the full-range of the \ZMVA distribution.
    The \Cref{fig:sideband_eb_nozmva,fig:sideband_mbc_nozmva} can be directly compared with \Cref{fig:Bboth_sidebands_eb,fig:sidebands_mbc3}, respectively.
    Without the $\mathtt{zernikeMVA}$ the agreement between data and simulation appears to be improved indicating that a component in data is not simulated adequately.
    The presence of a mismodelled component in the Belle~II simulation is apparent when inspecting the \ZMVA distribution.
    }
\end{figure}

These considerations are supported by inspecting the \ZMVA distribution in the $\mbox{\EB\in(1.4,1.8)~\gev}$ region, as seen in \Cref{fig:zmva_discrepancy}.
While simulation contains a sharp peak near 0, this is not evident in Belle~II data, which on the other hand has an excess at high-\ZMVA.
Hence, the background suppression efficiency is not well-represented in \MC.
These results are also conflated with the differences in the \Mbc endpoint, making an exact evaluation of the effect difficult at this stage.
Independent studies of the \ZMVA distributions, performed similarly to the photon detection efficiency study described in \Cref{sec:photon_efficiency}, did not observe the presence of such a peak.
This may imply that this type of selection is particular for photon candidates from \BB events misidentified as high-energy photons.
Therefore, it was concluded that additional studies of \ZMVA in the context of radiative and inclusive analyses will be necessary for future iterations of this analysis.

While these observations are alarming, so far all the results have shown that the \Mbc fitter and background-subtraction procedure were robust against the
continuum \Mbc distribution shape differences, as seen in \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation,sec:bb_background_validation}.
Therefore, this analysis does not replace or remove the \ZMVA requirement.

The fit is performed on the full sample of data, however, the results from the signal region, $\EB\in(1.8,2.7)$ are hidden and not investigated at this stage.
The individual \Mbc fits on the \EB sideband regions are shown for data in \Cref{fig:sideband_data_fit}, and for simulation in \Cref{fig:sideband_mc_fit}.

The summarised results of the good tag-\B meson yields estimated in the \Mbc fits are shown in \Cref{fig:sidebands_background_versus_data}.
In the high-\EB sideband, no peaking tag-\B mesons are observed in data or simulation, which is exactly consistent with the naive expectations.
In the low-\EB region, a large number of events is observed.
The data points are compatible with the background expectation, although the estimates in both intervals are higher than the expected background.
Subtracting the background expectation from the good tag-\B meson yield in data results in \Cref{fig:sidebands_subtracted}.
A similar observation follows: although both values are (nearly) compatible with zero,
the central values are slightly positive.

\end{figure}

The total number of events in the low-\EB sideband is $2698\pm139$ (expected to be predominantly background, see \Cref{sec:binning}).
The background expectation from simulation in the same region is $2483\pm130$.
Taking the ratio of these values yields $1.087\pm0.080$.
As this value is not compatible with unity within $1\sigma$, a background scaling of 8.7\% is adopted.
100\% of the scaling will also be adopted as a systematic uncertainty later.
The scaled-background-subtracted data fit yields are shown in \Cref{fig:sidebands_subtracted_corrected}.
By construction, they are fully compatible with zero.

% \subsection{Summary of study of validation samples}\label{sec:summary_of_validation}

% As there were quite a few important points presented in \Cref{sec:validation}, 
% a quick summary is produced here to condense the most important findings.
% The main observations are as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Good \EB spectrum description in \epem\ra\qqbar events, is observed in \Cref{sec:continuum_spectrum_validation,sec:continuum_mbc_validation}.
%     \item Problems with \Mbc distribution endpoint modelling, related to experimental condition variations in Belle~II data, which are not captured in run-period-independent simulation.
%     This is observed in \Cref{sec:continuum_mbc_validation}.
%     \item Related to the last point, differences with the shape of \epem\ra\qqbar events in simulation and data.
%     \item A new, corrected \Mbc variable introduced to partially compensate the \Mbc endpoint difference in data and simulation.
%     \item The fitter can accurately describe the number of good tag-\B meson events in data and simulation.
%     \item A scaling factor is introduced, which will also be adopted as a systematic uncertainty related to normalisation.
% \end{itemize}
