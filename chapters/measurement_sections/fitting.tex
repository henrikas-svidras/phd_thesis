By this point in the analysis, all the selections have been finalised and discussed.
Furthermore, clear definitions for tag-$B$ mesons that properly kinematically constrain \BtoXsgamma are presented, such that \EB is evaluated accurately.
However, as can be seen in \Cref{fig:spectrum_after_optimisation}, even if continuum and $\BB$ backgrounds are suppressed heavily compared to the initial sample (\Cref{fig:spectrum_after_reco}),
there is still a significantly more background events than \BtoXsgamma signal events.
Many of these, particularly continuum background, originate from incorrect tag-$B$ meson reconstruction (see \Cref{fig:good_tag_definitions}) and can therefore be estimated in data using an \Mbc fitting procedure.
In this Section, a thorough overview of the \Mbc fit is presented which extracts the counts of good tag-$B$ in different \EB intervals.
All fits shown in this Section are unbinned extended negative log-likelihood fits, as presented in \Cref{sec:fitting_theory}.


\subsection{Components in the selected data set}\label{sec:fitting_components}

There are three types of events in the \epem collision data set following all the selections described so far:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generic \BB (including \BtoXsgamma) that are tagged with a good tag-$B$;
    \item Generic \BB (including \BtoXsgamma) that are tagged with a misreconstructed tag-$B$;
    \item Photon candidates originating in $\epem\ra\qqbar$.
\end{itemize}
These three components are referred to as `peaking', `combinatorial \BB' and `continuum' throughout \Cref{sec:fitting_mbc}.
These components, extracted from generic \MC, are visualised in \Cref{fig:tag_component_fits}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:good_tags_fit}}{

    }
    \caption{\label{fig:tag_component_fits} Separate components that are present in generic \MC after selections that suppress background (\Cref{tab:cutflow}).
    The individual components are defined in the text of \Cref{sec:fitting_components}.
    Each distribution contains an unbinned fit to the data points, and the subpanels show the pull (\Cref{eq:pull_distribution}) in each case.
    The fitting function for peaking tag \B mesons (\Cref{fig:good_tags_fit}) is chosen as the Crystal Ball function;
    for combinatorial tag \B mesons (\Cref{fig:combinatorial_tags_fit}) it is chosen as the 5th order Chebyshev;
    for continuum \epem\ra\qqbar events (\Cref{fig:argus_tags_fit}) it is chosen as the ARGUS function.
    }
\end{figure}

The fitting model is prepared to describe the three components and, particularly, to extract the number of tag-$B$ candidates that correspond to the `peaking' component.
The strategy to describe each component is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Peaking \Mbc distributions are often fitted using a Crystal Ball function.
    It is defined in \Cref{sec:crystal_Ball} and can be understood as a Gaussian distribution with a polynomial tail.
    \Cref{fig:good_tags_fit} illustrates the suitability to describe the peaking \Mbc distribution.
    \item Continuum \Mbc distributions are conventionally described by the ARGUS function designed specifically for continuum events, defined in \Cref{sec:argus_distribution}.
    This function is used to describe $\epem\ra\qqbar$ simulated backgrounds in this analysis and shown in \Cref{fig:argus_tags_fit}.
    \item The particular shape of the combinatorial \BB background is generally dependent on the signal mode and does not have a conventional method of description.
    In this analysis, the usage of \FEI and the fact that background events are conservatively suppressed to avoid signal-side biases lead to a wide but slightly peaking shape.
    Several options were assessed, but it was found to be suitably described by a Chebyshev polynomial, which can be adapted to a necessary functional shape.
    The definition of Chebyshev polynomials is given in \Cref{sec:chebyshev_distribution}.
    A 5th-order polynomial describes the combinatorial \BB background distribution in \Cref{fig:combinatorial_tags_fit},
\end{itemize}
In \Cref{fig:tag_component_fits}, the subpanels show the pull distribution, defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pull_distribution}
    \mathrm{pull}(x) = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}. 
\end{equation}
Throughout this thesis it is used to evaluate the quality of the fit, as repeated measurements of a random variable $x$ should fluctuate around a mean value $\mu$ with a statistical width $\sigma$.
Therefore, any dependencies or structures observed in the pull distribution would be indicators of poor fit quality. 

\subsection{Photon energy intervals for the fit}\label{sec:binning}

It is clear from \Cref{fig:spectrum_after_optimisation} that the signal-to-background ratio changes across all \EB intervals.
Furthermore, even continuum-to-\BB event fractions are not constant.
This is a result of the fact that photons related to \epem\ra\qqbar backgrounds are more likely to extend to high-\EB values because they do not originate from a \B meson which is always produced with an energy $\approx\sqrt{s}/2$ at Belle~II.
The goal of the fit, as discussed in the introduction of this Section, is to remove combinatorial \BB and continuum events from further analysis.
While an overall \Mbc fit could be performed, such an approach necessarily loses event-level information, such as the energies of individual photons, and only provides the event counts in the fitted \EB region.
Moreover, the background composition is expected to vary with \EB, hence such an overall fit may generally be suboptimal.

Instead, in this analysis, the photon spectrum is divided into multiple \EB intervals, and the \Mbc distributions belonging to each interval are fitted using the functions described in \Cref{sec:fitting_components}.
This approach reduces the existing data set to multiple \EB intervals with known good tag-\B counts, completely removing continuum and combinatorial \BB events from the data set.
Such an approach means that the final photon energy spectrum is provided with the same binning as used for fitting.
It is therefore important to optimise the chosen intervals for the fit with respect to the expected \BtoXsgamma signal-to-background ratio, 
even if the primary goal of the fit is not signal extraction.

Three scenarios are tested for $\EB\in(1.4,2.8)~\gev$: 50~\mev, 100~\mev and 200~\mev wide bins.
The test is performed by evaluating the statistical significance, with a definition equivalent to \Cref{eq:soversqrtsplusb}, on a data set scaled to 189~\invfb.
In this case, the background is considered as non-\BtoXsgamma events that remain after the \Mbc fit: only correctly tagged \BB events (no combinatorial or continuum background).
The result of the study of the statistical significance for the hybrid-signal model (\Cref{sec:signal_model}) is shown in \Cref{fig:binning_significance}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/fitting/binning_significance.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:binning_significance}
    The statistical significance based on \Cref{eq:soversqrtsplusb}.
    Here, $S$ is taken as the number of \BtoXsgamma events after fitting and $B$ is taken as non-\BtoXsgamma events expected after fitting in each \EB interval.
    Three scenarios are tested: 50~\mev, 100~\mev and 200~\mev wide bins.
    The final binning chosen is a hybrid scenario described in \Cref{sec:binning}.
    The hybrid model described in \Cref{sec:signal_model} is used for this study.
    }    
\end{figure}

In general, the highest statistical significance is observed with the widest bins, but this method, by definition, contains the least amount of information about the spectrum.
Irrespective of the bin width,  $\EB\in(1.4,1.8)$ and $\EB>2.7~\gev$ show a statistical significance lower than unity, therefore the selected binning should attempt to maximise it.
In the case of $\EB\in(1.9,2.0)~\gev$, it is observed that a similar statistical significance can be achieved in $\EB\in(1.8,2.0)~\gev$.
This motivates choosing the wider bin to achieve a lower threshold than the one in the analysis by BaBar~\cite{BaBar:2007yhb}.
On the other hand, the studies performed in \Cref{sec:resolution_studies} showed that the resolution of \EB is expected to be roughly $30-40~\mev$.
Choosing a fine binning \EB compared to the resolution may lead to complications in the unfolding procedure.
As the simpler bin-by-bin unfolding is employed in this analysis, the 50~\mev bins were not considered.

These considerations led to choosing the following eleven \EB bins for the analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Three 200~\mev bins for $\EB\in(1.4,2.0)~\gev$;
    \item Seven 100~\mev bins for $\EB\in(2.0,2.7)~\gev$;
    \item A single, inclusive overflow bin $\EB>2.7~\gev$.
\end{itemize}
This choice provides a compromise between statistical significance, \EB spectrum resolution and complications in unfolding.
The expected continuum, combinatorial, correctly-tagged non-\BtoXsgamma and correctly-tagged \BtoXsgamma event count expectations for the chosen binning are provided in \Cref{tab:expected_events}.
The Table entry containing combinatorial tag-\B backgrounds may include events where \BtoXsgamma are present.
However, they are rejected as background in the \Mbc fits.
On the other hand, the peaking-\BB background, which is not rejected by the \Mbc fit and treated in \Cref{sec:background_subtraction}, is separated from \BtoXsgamma.
The Table also highlights the importance of a valid binning; several bins can achieve a comparable statistical significance to what could be achieved if just a single bin was used.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \caption{\label{tab:expected_events}
    The expected number of events as a fraction of the data set after selections in \Cref{tab:cutflow}, for the binning chosen in \Cref{sec:binning}.
    The table also shows corresponding statistical significance for a 189~\invfb sized data set.
    }
    \input{tables/expected_events.tex}
\end{table}

Because of the low expected statistical significance, $\EB\in(1.4,1.8)$ and $\EB>2.7~\gev$ are chosen as validation regions.
They are referred to as \textit{sidebands}.
The \textit{signal region} of the analysis is defined as $\EB\in(1.8,2.7)~\gev$.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Mbc}{Mbc} fit model building}\label{sec:fitting_setup}

The functions introduced in \Cref{sec:fitting_components} and \Cref{sec:appendix_fitting_functions} are now considered in terms of the defined binning in \Cref{sec:binning}.
They are used to build an \Mbc fit model for the total data set.
The implementation of an $N$-th order Chebyshev polynomial, a Crystal Ball function and an ARGUS function results
in $N+6$ model parameters and 3 normalisation parameters for each \EB bin.
For fit stability purposes, it is desirable to reduce this number.
Firstly, a primary fit model is prepared, where some of the parameters can be pre-determined or shared amongst the bins.
The key idea is that all the functions are fitted once, separately, on the subsets of the simulated data that they aim to describe.
This also provides the initialisation values of the parameters that are used on the final fit of the total entire data set.
The primary fits for every component are discussed in the following Subsections.

\subsubsection{Crystal Ball primary fit}\label{sec:crystal_ball_prefit}

The Crystal Ball function describes the distribution of peaking tag-\B mesons in \Mbc in terms of shape parameters $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\alpha$ and $n$ and the normalisation of the \PDF, $\mathcal{N}$ (see \Cref{eq:crystal_ball}).
In principle, the reconstruction of the tag-\B meson should not be strongly influenced by the signal-\B meson, which means that the shape parameters should not depend on \EB.
This hypothesis is tested in \Cref{fig:crystal_ball_par_test}.
It can be seen that strong correlations between \EB and parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are absent.
This test is not performed on parameters $\alpha$ and $n$, as they tend to be less stable than $\mu$ and $\sigma$, depending more on the fluctuations of the data set.
It is therefore concluded that a single Crystal Ball shape is sufficient, where all \EB bins share the same shape parameters.
The discussed primary fits are performed simultaneously on the peaking tag-$B$ meson \Mbc distributions in \MC for all \EB bins.
They are shown in \Cref{fig:primary_cb_fits}.
The evaluated shape parameters are fixed for the final \Mbc fit model.
The parameter values and uncertainties from the primary fit are shown in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:crystal_ball_mus}}{
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/fitting/Crystal_Ball_PDF_test_mu.pdf}

        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/fitting/Crystal_Ball_PDF_test_sigma.pdf}
    }
    \caption{\label{fig:crystal_ball_par_test}The parameters from \Mbc fits of peaking tag-\B mesons in generic \BB simulation, using a Crystal Ball function.
    The datapoints showcase the estimated parameters $\mu$ (\Cref{fig:crystal_ball_mus}) and $\sigma$ (\Cref{fig:crystal_ball_sigmas}) for different
    \EB intervals.
    This can be compared with the overall shape (blue band), which is determined if the entire $\EB\in(1.4,2.8)~\gev$ region is fitted.
    The parameters of the blue band correspond to the fit in \Cref{fig:good_tags_fit}.
    No strong dependence on \EB is observed.
    }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chebyshev polynomial primary fit}\label{sec:chebyshev_prefit}

The Chebyshev \PDF takes $N$ parameters, $k_i$ ($i=\{1,..N\}$), and a normalisation, $\mathcal{N}$ (\Cref{eq:chebyshev_pdf}).
$N$ is therefore referred to as the \textit{order} of the Chebyshev \PDF.
Third, fourth and fifth order Chebyshev polynomials are tested for suitability to describe the combinatorial \BB background distribution.
The fifth-order result was already introduced in \Cref{fig:combinatorial_tags_fit}.
The results of the best fit for lower-order polynomials are presented in \Cref{fig:lower_order_chebyshev}.
From the pull distributions in the subpanels and the general inspection of the fit, it is clear that using a polynomial of order lower than five is insufficient for an adequate description of combinatorial \BB events.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:3rd_order_chebyshev}}{
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/fitting/3rd_order_chebyshev_polynomial.pdf}
    }
    \subcaptionbox{\label{fig:4th_order_chebyshev}}{
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/fitting/4th_order_chebyshev_polynomial.pdf}
    }
    \caption{\label{fig:lower_order_chebyshev}The \Mbc fits of combinatorial \BB events with a third-order Chebyshev \PDF (\Cref{fig:3rd_order_chebyshev}) or 4 (\Cref{fig:4th_order_chebyshev}).
    These figures can be compared to \Cref{fig:combinatorial_tags_fit}.
    Lower-order Chebyshev polynomials are unable to accurately describe the combinatorial \BB data.
    }
\end{figure}


The coefficients $k_{1-5}$ of the Chebyshev polynomial cannot be easily connected to physical observables,
and therefore it is hard to evaluate their dependence on \EB.
As such, three different Chebyshev PDFs are evaluated for the following intervals: $\EB\in(1.4,1.6)$, $\EB\in(1.6,1.8)$, $\EB>1.8$ \gev.
The last interval is not subdivided further because of the data set size (see \Cref{tab:expected_events}), each interval is optimised to contain an approximately equal expected number of events.
The discussed primary fits are performed simultaneously on the \Mbc distributions of the combinatorial \BB in all \EB bins.
They are shown in \Cref{fig:primary_cheb_fits}.
The determined coefficients $k_{1-5}$ are fixed for the final \Mbc fit model.
The primary fit values are presented in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params}.

\subsubsection{ARGUS primary fit}\label{sec:argus_prefit}

Similarly to the previous cases, the ARGUS function has 2 parameters, $c$ and $m_0$, and a normalisation $\mathcal{N}$ (\Cref{eq:argus_function}).
Unlike the coefficients of the Chebyshev, $c$ and $m_0$ are easier to understand intuitively: with $m_0$ corresponding to the maximum allowed \Mbc values in the distribution and $c$ to the shape of continuum background.
More generally, the variation of $c$ and $m_0$ accounts for possible background shape differences between \MC and data.
It offers an additional layer of flexibility through a variation of relative ARGUS and Chebyshev normalisation values.
This means that allowing a degree of variation in the ARGUS shape is beneficial to account for possible background differences in data.

Following these considerations, a setup is adopted with independent shapes for  \mbox{$\EB\in(1.4,1.6)$~\gev}, \mbox{$\EB\in(1.6,1.8)$~\gev}, $\EB>1.8$~\gev.
In each respective range, one single shape parameter $c^{(1.4-1.6)}$, $c^{(1.6-1.8)}$, $c^{(>1.8)}$ is determined from the total fit.
To account for possible differences between simulated and data $\sqrt{s}$, the $m_0$ parameter is shared between all bins and is also determined from the fit of the combined data set.
The discussed primary fits are performed simultaneously on continuum \Mbc distributions in all \EB bins.
They are shown in \Cref{fig:primary_argus_fits}.
The initial values for the final \Mbc fit model are presented in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params}.

\subsubsection{Final fit model}

Based on the primary fits of the subcomponents of the total data set, the number of fitting parameters is reduced:
certain fit parameters are shared between different \EB intervals, whereas other parameters are kept at their initialised value and not varied.
The final \Mbc fitting model for the analysis is summarised in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params}.
It shows the initial values for each parameter and highlights which parameters are kept fixed in the final \Mbc fit.
It can be seen, that the previously introduced $11\cdot(5+2+4+3)=154$ parameters are reduced to $37$ fitting parameters.
The fitting model is then applied to the total data set in \Cref{sec:mbc_fit_full_mc} 
in order to estimate the main parameter of interest: 
normalisations of the Crystal Ball in every \EB bin (i.e. the number of good tag-$B$ in each \EB bin).
The primary \Mbc fits determining the parameters in 
\Cref{tab:fitting_init_params} on corresponding data sets are given in \Cref{sec:appendix_primary_fits}. 
\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{tab:fitting_init_params} 
    The summary of the fitting model used in this analysis for the \Mbc fit.
    For the final \Mbc fit, the parameters are initialised at the values that are listed, corresponding to the ones determined in the primary fitting steps, explained in \Cref{sec:crystal_ball_prefit,sec:chebyshev_prefit,sec:argus_prefit}.
    The values that are bolded in the Table are not estimated from the final \Mbc fit but are kept at their initialised values.
    On the other hand, all non-bolded values can vary in the final fit.
    Uncertainties are evaluated using the \texttt{HESSE} method in the primary fitting steps.
    They are omitted if the relative uncertainty is lower than $0.1\%$.
    }
\input{tables/fit_model.tex}
\end{table}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Mbc}{Mbc} fit on the total simulated data set}\label{sec:mbc_fit_full_mc}

The prepared fit, discussed in \Cref{sec:fitting_setup}, is applied to the total generic \MC data set.
The initial values of the fit are given in \Cref{tab:fitting_init_params} and all bins are fitted simultaneously.
The fit results are shown in \Cref{fig:primary_full_fits}.
The overall \Mbc distributions are accurately described for all \EB bins, irrespective of the overall number of data points that are being fitted.
This is already an important achievement: a single fitting setup is adaptive enough to cover different signal-to-background ratios, statistical sample sizes and overall shapes of the distributions.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    This highlights that the fit setup accurately describes large simulated data samples.
    }
\end{figure}

As was already mentioned, the main goal of the \Mbc fit introduced in this Section is to extract the good tag-\B counts in each \EB bin.
This is equivalent to the normalisation parameter of the Crystal Ball \PDF, $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}$.
These normalisations are shown in \Cref{fig:generic_mc_fit_yield_comparisons}.
The exact values of the rest of the parameters are not needed for further analysis, as long as an unbiased and accurate description of good tag-\B counts is achieved through $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{CB}}$.
The main goal of keeping them as free parameters in the fit is to ensure that the \Mbc background shape and yield estimations are sufficiently flexible to account for potential data-simulation discrepancies.
Therefore, for the rest of the thesis, other parameters will not be explicitly mentioned, unless their values are relevant to the discussion.

To ensure that the fit is receptive to changes of \BtoXsgamma signal, two simple tests are devised, where the fit is performed on generic \MC but
\begin{itemize}
    \item all \BtoXsgamma signal events are removed;
    \item \BtoXsgamma signal shape in generic \MC is reweighted using the hybrid model weights.
\end{itemize}
The results are shown in \Cref{fig:no_bxsgamma_mc_fit_yield_comparisons,fig:weighted_mc_fit_yield_comparisons}.
It is clear that if the \BtoXsgamma events are completely removed or reweighted, the \Mbc fit presented in this Subsection responds appropriately.
Therefore, although a particular simulation model was used when preparing the fit, no particular bias towards any \BtoXsgamma model is introduced.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    Additionally, results are shown for the fits on the generic \MC data set but with all \BtoXsgamma events removed (\Cref{fig:no_bxsgamma_mc_fit_yield_comparisons}),
    and for generic \MC data set but with the hybrid-signal model reweighting introduced (\Cref{fig:weighted_mc_fit_yield_comparisons}).
    In each case, the uncertainties are $\texttt{HESSE}$ uncertainties estimated by the fit.
    It can be seen that the fit is receptive to the expected count of peaking tag-$B$ mesons.
    Larger uncertainties in \Cref{fig:weighted_mc_fit_yield_comparisons} are due to known issues in weighted error estimation.
    They do not affect this analysis as weighted fits are not performed later.
