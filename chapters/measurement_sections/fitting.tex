By this point in the analysis all the selections have been finalised and discussed.
Furthermore, clear definitions for tag-$B$ mesons that properly kinematically constrain \BtoXsgamma are presented, such that \EB is evaluated accurately.
However, as can be seen \Cref{fig:spectrum_after_optimisation}, even though continuum and $\BB$ backgrounds is suppressed heavily compared to the \EB distributions that was begun with (\Cref{fig:spectrum_after_reco}),
there is still a significantly larger number of background processes than \BtoXsgamma signal events.
Many of these, particularly continuum background, originate from incorrect tag-$B$ mesons (see \Cref{fig:good_tag_definitions}) and can therefore be estimated in data using an \Mbc fitting procedure.
In this section, a thorough overview of the \Mbc fit will be presented which will extract the counts of good-$B$ tags in different \EB intervals.
