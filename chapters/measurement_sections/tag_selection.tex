In \Cref{sec:reconstruction_overview} it was discussed that in about a half of all reconstructed events there exists more than one tag-side candidate.
That does not take into account the overlap between \feiBp and \feiBz mode -- which further enhances this effect.
Performing the best tag-side $B$ candidate selection is important, as multiple entries per event should not be included in the final sample.
In this section, the definitions for best-candidate selection are discussed.
Furthermore, a concrete definition for tag-$B$ mesons with correctly reconstructed kinematic properties is introduced.

\subsection{Selection within the same \texorpdfstring{\FEI}{FEI} mode}

The number of tag-side candidates for \feiBp and \feiBz modes, after the optimised selections in \Cref{tab:cutflow},
is shown in XXXX.
