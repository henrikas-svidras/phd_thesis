\chapter{Theoretical overview}

In this Chapter, the theoretical overview of the Standard Model, flavour physics and \BtoXsgamma will be presented.
It will introduce the main theoretical concepts that are featured in this thesis and provide a theoretical grounding for the experimental analyses performed.

\section{The Standard Model}

a $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ quantum field theory \cite{Peskin:1995ev}.
Its theoretical framework describes the electroweak and strong force interactions between elementary particles that constitute the world as we know it.
The elementary particles included in the Standard Model can have a half-integer spin (fermions) or integer spin (bosons).
The spin-1 bosons are the mediators of the electromagnetic (photon), weak ($\Wpm$ and $\Z$) and strong interactions (gluon) in the SM.
The spin-0 Higgs boson couples to all massive particles of the Standard Model via the Higgs mechanism \cite{PhysRevLett.13.508}.
The fermions are subsplit into two additional groups, quarks and leptons, which, respectively, can and cannot interact through the strong force.

\section{Radiative decays \texorpdfstring{\BtoXsdgamma}{B->Xsg}}\label{eq:btosgamma_theory}

In the Standard Model, $b\ra s$ transitions are mediated by so-called flavour-changing neutral currents.
These processes can only occur through loops mediated by heavy particles.
One of the decay processes used to study these transitions are the so-called rare radiative $b\ra s\g$ and $b\ra d\g$ decays.
Due to colour confinement of the quarks, in reality they manifest as \BtoXsgamma or \BtoXdgamma, where $X_s$ and $X_d$ denote any meson state originating from the $s$ quark hadronisation.
The leading Standard Model diagrams for \BtoXsdgamma (used to collectively identify $X_s$ and $X_d$ states) processes are shown in \Cref{fig:sm_diagrams}.

\Cref{fig:sm_diagrams} shows the leading-order Standard Model diagrams, where the $b\ra s$ transition occurs via electroweak loops.
A beyond-Standard Model scenario where this transition is mediated by a charged-Higgs boson particle is shown in \Cref{fig:bsm_diagrams}.

Since \BtoXsdgamma decays proceed via $b\ra s\g$ transitions, they are interesting probes for beyond-Standard-Model (\BSM) particles. 
The leading contributions to these transitions only happen via one-loop diagrams, as seen in \Cref{fig:b_to_s_gamma_diagrams}.
The electroweak loop can get contributions from all the quarks, but is dominated by the much heavier top quark \cite{Mannel:2001vn} as followed by the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}. 
Furthermore, the masses of possible \BSM weakly-interacting particles that can appear in the loops may be as high as \order{(100~\tev)} \cite{Misiak:2020vlo} which makes studying these decays incredibly appealing.

The decay rate of \BtoXsdgamma is affected by the contributions from weak and strong interactions.
Weak contributions can be calculated perturbatively, however the strong contributions are usually described by effective point-like theories.
In weak decays, including \BtoXsgamma, \textit{Operator Product Expansion} \cite{Peskin:1995ev,Buras:1998raa} is used to derive the effective theory.
It replaces the hadron-binding strong quark interactions and the weak quark interactions mediating $\b\ra\s$ by a single effective vertex.
An effective Lagrangian describing the \BtoXsdgamma can be written as~\cite{Kaminski:2012eb,Misiak:2015xwa}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:effective_lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{4G_F}{\sqrt{2}}V_{ts}^*V_{tb}\left[\sum^{8}_{i=1}\mathcal{C}_i(\mu)\mathcal{O}_i(\mu)
                                                + \frac{V^*_{uq}V_{ub}}{V^*_{tq}V_{tb}}\sum^{2}_{i=1}\mathcal{C}_i(\mu)(\mathcal{O}_i(\mu)-\mathcal{O}_i^u(\mu))\right],
\end{equation}
where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. 
The factors $\mathcal{C}_i$, known as \textit{Wilson coefficients}, encode the weak interactions and can be calculated perturbatively.
The other set of operators, $\mathcal{O}_i$ contain the contributions from the strong interactions and are calculated using non-perturbative methods.
The renormalisation scale, $\mu$, is chosen such that strong and weak contributions are separated.
Conventionally, it is chosen to be of order of the $b$ quark mass $\mu\sim m_b$.

The exact expressions of operators $\mathcal{O}_i$ are given in \Cref{sec:appendix_local_opperators}. 
Coefficients $\mathcal{C}_3-6$ have been calculated and shown to be small, therefore the most important contributions arise from $\mathcal{O}_{1,2,7,8}$ \cite{Chetyrkin:1996vx,Misiak:2020vlo}.
Furthermore, the ratio $V^*_{uq}V_{ub}/V^*_{tq}V_{tb}$ is small for the case of $q=s$ \cite{Charles:2015gya}, and the terms including $\mathcal{O}^u_i$ can be safely neglected in calculations of the total decay rate \cite{Misiak:2015xwa}.
Interestingly, the latter point does not hold for \BtoXdgamma case, where additional effects need to be considered due to the contributions from these terms.
In particular, additional non-perturbative uncertainties may come into play \cite{Misiak:2015xwa}.
However, for the rest of \Cref{eq:btosgamma_theory}, this thesis will focus on \BtoXsgamma decays unless explicitly stated, as this is the main analysis of the thesis.

The decay rate of the \BtoXsgamma is as a sum of a perturbative and non-perturbative contribution as \cite{Misiak:2015xwa}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:btosgammarate_nonp}
    \Gamma(\bar{B}\ra\X_q\g) = \Gamma(b\ra q\g) + \delta\Gamma_{\mathrm{non-p.}}, \quad q=s,d.
\end{equation}
The $\Gamma(b\ra q\g)$ is the perturbatively calculable rate of $b$ quarks decaying into charmless partons, and $\delta\Gamma_{non-p.}$ is the non-perturbative contribution arising outside of local operator product expansion.
The non perturbative effects arise from .... ?
\todo[inline]{ where do they arise from?}
As long as an appropriate photon energy threshold (in the decaying $B$ meson frame), \EB, is chosen, the non-perturbative effects in \Cref{eq:btosgammarate_nonp} can be considered much smaller.
Until recently, a 5\% uncertainty was attached to this assumption \cite{Benzke:2010js}. 
However, recent developments in understanding the non-perturbative effects \cite{Gunawardana:2019gep} led to an improved treatment of the associated uncertainties \cite{Misiak:2020vlo}.
As will be seen later, the threshold for \EB is motivated also from the experimental side, as large background-process contamination is present in the low-\EB region.

Perturbative term calcluation....






At lowest order, $b\ra\s(\d) \g$ is a two-body decay, which means that the decay rate peaks very close to the kinematic limit equal to half the \B-meson mass, $\lsim E_{\g}$.
